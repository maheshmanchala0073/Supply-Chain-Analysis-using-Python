Supply chain analysis entails a comprehensive examination of the entire supply chain process, encompassing everything from the acquisition of raw materials to the delivery of finished products to customers. The objective is to identify areas where enhancements can be made to increase efficiency and add more value to customers. This process typically involves scrutinizing various aspects such as transportation, inventory management, production procedures, and supplier relationships. By leveraging data and analytical tools, businesses can pinpoint inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and avenues for improvement within their supply chains, ultimately leading to cost reductions and improved customer satisfaction.
